      "description": "Cannelloni with minced meat is ready in a short time. The combination of minced meat, béchamel sauce, cheese and cannelloni baked in the oven creates a delicious dish. In original recipes, parmesan cheese is used but you can use your favorite cheese and add also your favorite spices like chili flakes and no salt and nutmeg powder in béchamel sauce. Create your own healthy oven-baked cannelloni recipe.",
