      "description": "Risotto is an Italian dish made by cooking a starchy, short grain rice like arborio with stock until it becomes creamy. When you serve it on a plate, risotto should spread out into a silky, spoonable pool. Because it’s made with just a few ingredients, there is a lot of emphasis on the cooking technique: slowly ladling in warm stock to a pan full of rice, stirring until the stock is absorbed, ladling in some more stock and repeating. The dish is often finished with butter and freshly grated Parmesan to really kick up the creamy flavor, although the rice can be a neutral background to whatever you have on hand in the fridge – whether it’s a bit of leftover bacon or some gorgeous fresh green peas.",
